## InClass Comparison

```{r inclass-comp-setup1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ponzo_data <- read_csv("data/01-s01/inclass/PonzoAgeData.csv")
```

* **Note 1:** Headings in this comparison will appear one size smaller than if you were to knit the Rmd due to rendering. Do not worry if yours look a bit bigger, it is more that you have them as **headers** is the key part.
* **Note 2:** You will not see numbers next to your headings (e.g. 1.6.1). Again this is just for rendering purposes. Your output should match the output of knitting [the .Rmd document found here](data/01-s01/inclass/ProducedPonzoTemplate.zip)

### Lab 1 - The Magnitude of the Ponzo Illusion varies as a function of Age

```{r load-data, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
ponzo_data <- read_csv("PonzoAgeData.csv")
```

### Introduction

The Ponzo Illusion is where...

**There are two underlying hypotheses that may explain the Ponzo Illusion. These are: **

1. The Framing hypothesis
2. The Perspective hypothesis

### Methods

#### Data
The data in this report was obtained from within the original paper, [Lebowitz and Judisch (2016)]( https://www.jstor.org/stable/1420548?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)

#### Stimuli
![PonzoIllusion](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/89/Ponzo_Illusion.jpg)

### Results
```{r lab1-inclass-table, echo=FALSE}
group_by(ponzo_data, Sex) %>% summarise(NofGroups=n(), mean_length = mean(ComparisonLength))
```

```{r lab1-inclass-figure, include=TRUE, fig.cap = "You won't have a caption. We will cover that later!"}
ggplot(ponzo_data, 
       aes(x = Mean_Age, y = ComparisonLength, color = Sex)) +
  geom_point()
```
